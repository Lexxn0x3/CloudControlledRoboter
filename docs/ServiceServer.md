# Server Autostart Service

This documentation explains how to manage the `robotServerAutostart.service`, which is designed to automatically start, stop, and restart specific server applications as defined in the script `downloadservice.sh`. This service can be particularly useful for ensuring that essential applications are always running, especially after a system reboot.

## Starting the Service

To start the `robotServerAutostart` service, execute the following command:

```bash
sudo systemctl start robotServerAutostart
```

This will initiate the service as per the configuration specified in the service file.

## Stopping the Service

To stop the service, use the command:

```bash
sudo systemctl stop robotServerAutostart
```

This will halt all processes that were started by the `robotServerAutostart` service.

## Restarting the Service

To restart the service, which is often needed after making changes to its configuration or the associated script, use:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart robotServerAutostart
```

After making changes to the service file, it's necessary to reload the systemd daemon:

```bash
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
```

## Editing the Service

The service can be edited by modifying its service file, typically located at `/etc/systemd/system/robotServerAutostart.service`. Ensure you have the necessary permissions to edit this file.

## Editing the Download Script

The script used by the service to start the applications can be found at `/opt/roboterteam1/downloadservice.sh`. You can edit this script to change which applications are downloaded or how they are started. Make sure to restart the service and reload the systemd daemon after making changes to this script.

## Overview of the `robotServerAutostart` Service

The `robotServerAutostart` service is designed to automatically handle the startup of certain server applications. It involves the script `downloadservice.sh` that downloads the necessary server binaries from a specified repository and starts them with predefined configurations. This ensures that your server applications are consistently running with the correct settings and are restarted automatically in case of a system reboot or service interruption.
